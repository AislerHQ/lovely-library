**A carefully curated collection of symbols and footprints.**

Quickly find parts from our partners Würth Elektronik and Diotec by component parameters or MPNs. All parts are fully specified, parameters like datasheet, footprint and MPN are preset for your convenience. When using parts from this library you are eligible for discounts on PCBs and PCBA when uploading your project to aisler.net

### Motivation

The default KiCad library rarely provides fully specified symbols with orderable part numbers. Thus, users often do not specify a part number at all, resulting in additional support efforts when ordering assembled PCBs. We created this library to improve the development flow and encourage the usage of parts from our european component partners. 

This library is designed to augment the default library, not to replace it. As platinum sponsor we fully believe in KiCads mission and understand the importance of keeping the default library lean.
Our library is supposed to provide a seamless experience that abides to KiCad's standards and at the same time eases your development flo by adding relevant documentation for assembly and yourself.
